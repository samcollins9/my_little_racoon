// Sprint 2's taxonomy (Req 1) replaces the single copy/skip/conflict
// policy sprint 1 shipped with three explicit categories, each with its
// own rule:
//
//   FRAMEWORK_OWNED — shipped and maintained upstream; the user is never
//     expected to edit these. An upgrade OVERWRITES a changed file, always
//     backing up what was there first (Req 2), and REMOVES any file under
//     a framework-owned path that no longer exists upstream, also backed
//     up first (Req 4) — state.js, deleted in sprint 1, is the file that
//     motivated this: a stale install kept carrying it forever with no
//     way to clean it up.
//   USER_OWNED — designed to be customised (agent personas, this repo's
//     own CLAUDE.md inviting you to extend its "Project standards"
//     section). An upgrade NEVER overwrites these; a differing file is
//     reported as a conflict, same as before, just louder about whose
//     file it is (Req 3).
//   MERGED — .vscode/settings.json, .vscode/tasks.json, .gitignore. Real
//     merge logic, unchanged by this sprint except for one narrow
//     addition (removing a specific dead .gitignore line, Req 4).
//
// A small version marker (Req 5) records which release is installed, so a
// re-run can tell "first install" from "upgrade", name backups after the
// version being replaced, and report `installed X -> Y`. It lives under
// .claude/ (not .claude/agents or .claude/commands, so it never collides
// with either taxonomy) and is never sprint state, so it doesn't live
// under docs/sprints/.
