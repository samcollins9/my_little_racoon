// Sprint 36 fix round (QA1 FAIL, round 1, Reqs 1/2/3/4 of "REQUIRED
// BEFORE PASS"): replaces the Bash-permission-pattern approach to
// scoping headless Master Controller's git-commit grant to
// docs/sprints/ — real, run probes (QA1's P2/P3, reproduced) showed it
// cannot express that boundary at all:
//
//   - `Bash(git commit -m *)`'s own trailing wildcard covers a PATHSPEC
//     argument exactly as readily as it covers the commit message —
//     `git commit -m "tool tweak" scripts/tool.js` matched it and
//     committed a file entirely outside docs/sprints/, with zero
//     permission denials.
//   - `Bash(git add docs/sprints/*)` has the identical gap the moment a
//     SECOND pathspec is appended after the first (`git add
//     docs/sprints/x.md scripts/tool.js` — the whole line still starts
//     with the allowed prefix).
//
// Prefix-then-wildcard matching can express "the command line starts
// with X"; it structurally cannot express "contains ONLY X and nothing
// appended after it" for a command whose own syntax accepts an
// arbitrary number of trailing arguments — git add and git commit both
// do. No pattern in `HEADLESS_PERMISSION_PROFILES['master-controller']`
// (however many `-a`/`-A`/`--all` variants it disallows) closes this,
// because the vulnerable argument is a second PATH, not a flag.
//
// THE FIX moves enforcement out of the permission-pattern layer
// entirely and into real code — the same shape this project already
// uses for every other git-touching lifecycle action, except
// `scripts/sprint_lifecycle.py` is contractually forbidden from ever
// calling `git add`/`git commit` itself (CLAUDE.md's "Changes to this
// repo's own tooling"; the smoke test's own zero-git-calls assertion
// greps that exact file for it), so this is a SEPARATE wrapper script.
// Master Controller's headless profile grants Bash access to invoke
// THIS SCRIPT (`Bash(node scripts/mc-commit.js *)`) and nothing raw
// `git` at all — every path given to it is validated in real Node code
// (path.resolve + a strict, symlink-resolved prefix check against
// docs/sprints/) before anything ever reaches git, and this script's own
// CLI surface has no flag or argument that could ask it to run `git
// push`, `git commit -a`/`-am`, or `git add -A`/`.` — there is no code
// path here that constructs any of those. That is a mechanically
// testable property of THIS FILE (unit tested in launcher_test.js), not
// a permission-string heuristic graded UNESTABLISHED the way the
// Bash-pattern approach was.
//
// Usage:
//   node scripts/mc-commit.js --message "<commit message>" -- <path> [<path> ...]
//   node scripts/mc-commit.js --message-file <path-to-file> -- <path> [<path> ...]
//
// (--message-file preferred whenever the message might contain a
// backtick, `$`, or other shell metacharacter this file's own CLI
// invocation would otherwise have to quote correctly — the same
// established pattern every other free-text argument in this framework
// uses, e.g. qa1.md's own --notes-file. Reading the message from a file
// in Node, rather than as a Bash-quoted argument, is what removes the
// quoting risk; it is not needed for shell-injection safety once the
// message reaches THIS script, since spawnSync below is called with an
// argv array, never a shell string.)
//
// Behavior: resolves each given <path> against the repository root and
// refuses (exit 1, prints why, runs no git command at all) if ANY path
// does not resolve to exactly one of three allowlisted things (sprint 40,
// Req 2 widened this from docs/sprints/ alone): strictly inside
// docs/sprints/ (unchanged default — a `..` segment, an absolute path
// elsewhere, a symlink pointing outside, or a path that merely shares
// "docs/sprints" as a string prefix without being a real path inside it,
// e.g. `docs/sprints-evil/x`, are all still refused); CLAUDE.md itself,
// an exact single-file match, never a directory; or the project's own
// declared-or-default decisions log (also an exact single-file match,
// validated fresh on every run — see validateDecisionsLogDeclaration()
// below for exactly what that checks and refuses). Requires at least one
// path — there is no "commit everything" mode. If every path validates:
// stages exactly those paths (`git add -- <paths>`,
// needed because a brand-new sprint file is untracked and a pathspec
// commit alone does not stage an untracked path — confirmed directly:
// `git commit <new-path> -m msg` fails with "pathspec ... did not match
// any file(s) known to git" until `git add` runs first), then commits
// exactly those paths (`git commit -m <message> -- <paths>`, a real
// pathspec commit, nothing implicit, nothing else touched). Never runs
// `git push`. Exits non-zero with the real git error on any failure.
