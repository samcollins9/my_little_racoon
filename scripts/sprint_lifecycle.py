"""
Fully Completely — sprint lifecycle enforcement script.

This is the ONLY thing that should ever create, move, or edit sprint
state. Slash commands in .claude/commands/ call this script; they do
not touch files directly. See CLAUDE.md at the project root for the
full command reference.

Phases (in order, with the loops):

  dev_build        -> Dev Team 1/2 is building
  qa1_audit        -> QA1 static audit (gate 1). FAIL/CONDITIONAL sends
                       it back to dev_build. QA1 re-reads the sprint file
                       fresh immediately before recording this verdict, so
                       a mid-build requirements amendment doesn't slip
                       through on a stale read. A PASS also records a hash
                       of the sprint file as audited; dev-done mechanically
                       refuses (no override) if the file has changed since,
                       rather than relying only on QA1 remembering to
                       re-read. See dev_agreed_done below.
  dev_agreed_done  -> Dev Team has told Master Controller the coding
                       side is done. NOT the same as sprint complete.
  shipped          -> Pipeman has pushed to remote. The same PASS that
                       records the sprint-file hash also records the
                       audited commit's tree hash (content, not the SHA,
                       so a legitimate rebase/squash/merge before push
                       doesn't trip this); ship refuses, no override, if
                       the commit it's pushing doesn't match. Ship (and
                       reship) also record the full SHA actually pushed,
                       as last_shipped_commit, an identity, not content,
                       fact for groundtruth_live below to check against.
  groundtruth_live -> GroundTruth is live-testing. GroundTruth must pass
                       --deployed-commit, the SHA it actually tested;
                       this has to match last_shipped_commit exactly, no
                       tolerance for a differing SHA the way ship's
                       content check tolerates a rebase, there's no
                       legitimate reason a live test and what was shipped
                       would differ. FAIL/CONDITIONAL means fixes + a
                       reship, then GroundTruth tests again. A recorded
                       PASS here moves straight to complete_ready — there
                       used to be a QA1 "final check" gate here (gate 2),
                       but across ~13 real sprints it never once caught
                       anything gate 1 + GroundTruth's live test hadn't
                       already caught, so it was removed. The one real
                       value it had — a fresh look after mid-build
                       requirement changes — is now QA1's responsibility
                       at gate 1 (see above).
  complete_ready   -> Both gates (QA1 audit + GroundTruth live test) have
                       passed. Waiting for /sprint-complete AND the user's
                       explicit, real-time go-ahead (--user-said) to
                       actually close the sprint.
  complete         -> Closed. Sprint file moved to 3-done/.
  aborted          -> Abandoned. Sprint file moved to 5-abandoned/.

The "no override" language above is accurate for every path an agent can
reach: no flag on dev-done or ship bypasses either hash check, and neither
is documented anywhere an agent reads. There is a separate `override`
subcommand below (cmd_override) for the human running this project, not
wired to any slash command, not mentioned in CLAUDE.md or any agent file
on purpose, see docs/HUMAN_OVERRIDE.md before using it. groundtruth's
deployed-commit check has no override at all, in cmd_override or anywhere
else: unlike the QA1-to-ship content check, there's no legitimate
transform (rebase, squash, whatever) that would make a live test and what
was actually shipped differ and still be fine, so there's nothing here to
responsibly re-stamp.

    # record one without it — UNLESS a ship-hash override (cmd_override
    # --gate ship-hash) also landed in that same window: that means the
    # content Pipeman actually pushed differs from what QA1's PASS covered,
    # a human vouched for it, not QA1, so it must not be counted as an
    # audited miss either. Anything that doesn't fit one of these shapes is
